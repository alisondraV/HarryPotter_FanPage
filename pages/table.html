			<h2>Joanne Rowling</h2>
			<p>Joanne Rowling, writing under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist, philanthropist,film producer,
				television producer and screenwriter, best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. The books have won multiple
				awards, and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history. They have also been the basis 
				for a film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films in the series.</p>
			<p>Rowling had gained some creative control on the films, reviewing all the scripts as well as acting as a producer on the final 
				two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.</p>
			<p>Rowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuarón 
				collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards 
				in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.</p>
			<p>In September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an "expanded creative partnership" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films 
				about her character Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film was released in November 2016
				and is set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series. In 2016, it was announced that the series would consist of five films.
				The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in November 2018. Rowling scripted and co-produced both films.</p>
