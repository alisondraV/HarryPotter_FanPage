		<h3>Interesting facts about <i>Harry Potter</i> :</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The first batch of Hogwarts acceptance letters the graphics team hand wrote for the movie turned out to be too heavy for the owls to carry, 
			which meant that they had to individually hand write thousands of them all over again!</li>
		<li>For a film series that uses a lot of dragons it's nice to see that none of them were harmed 
			during the making of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. You can see the little in-joke hidden in the credits right near the end. </li>
		<li>The scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, in which 6 other people have to disguise themselves as wizard Harry, 
			took actor Daniel Radcliffe 90 tries to get it right. He had to act every part himself! </li>
		<li>Seven is used as a powerful magic number in Harry Potter world. There's the seven Harry's scene,
			seven books, seven snakes on the chamber of secrets door, and seven players in a Quidditch match.</li>
		<li>It took a photoshoot of 40 kittens to create Professor Delores Umbridge's moving kitten plates in her office.</li>
		<li>Each Death Eater mask was created with its own identifiable design.</li>
		<li>Between the filming of The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban, the real-life train
			used for the Hogwarts Express was vandalized, resulting in almost $4,000 in damage to its famous cars.</li>
		<li>In order to bring Dementors creatures to life, they were filmed underwater, 
			then animated in post-production to make it seem as if they were floating.</li>
		<li>All the furniture placed in the front towers in the Ministry of Magic was made out of cardboard.</li>
